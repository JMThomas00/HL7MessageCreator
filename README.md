## Overview

HL7 Message Creator is a comprehensive tool designed for healthcare IT professionals who need to generate and manage standardized HL7 messages for:

- Scheduling surgical procedures
- Managing patient admission, discharge, and transfer events
- Handling case event timelines (arrival, prep, in-room, completion, recovery, etc.)
- Testing HL7 interfaces and integrations

The application provides both creation and editing capabilities through an intuitive dual-mode interface, backed by CSV-based data sources for procedures, staff, surgeons, patients, and allergies.

## Features

### Creator Mode

- **Procedure Browser**: Search and select from comprehensive surgical procedure database organized by specialty and category
- **Allergy Management**: Select and assign patient allergies for ADT messages
- **Staff Assignment**: Assign surgeons, circulators, scrub techs, CRNAs, and anesthesiologists
- **Multiple Message Types**:
  - Scheduled (S12): Single scheduling message
  - Scheduled & Case Events (S12 + S14): Scheduling plus complete surgical timeline
  - Scheduled & Canceled (S12 + S15): Scheduling with cancellation
- **Smart Date/Time Controls**: Quick-select buttons for common date/time adjustments
- **Live Preview**: Real-time HL7 message preview as you build
- **Multiple Patients**: Create and manage multiple patients in one session
- **Batch Export**: Save messages to organized folders (CurrentDay/NextDay/PreviousDay)

### Editor Mode

   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller==6.1.5
   ```

2. **Build using the spec file**:

   ```bash
   pyinstaller HL7MessageCreatorFileView20.spec
   ```

3. **Locate the executable**:

   - Built executable: `dist/HL7MessageCreatorFileView20.exe`
   - Ensure CSV data files are in the same directory as the executable

## HL7 Message Types

### SIU (Scheduling Information Unsolicited)

#### S12 - Notification of New Appointment Booking

- Used for scheduling new surgical procedures
- Contains patient demographics, procedure details, location, and staff assignments

#### S14 - Notification of Appointment Modification

- Used for case event updates (patient arrival, room entry, procedure start, etc.)
- Tracks surgical timeline with timestamps

#### S15 - Notification of Appointment Cancellation

- Used to cancel scheduled procedures

### ADT (Admit, Discharge, Transfer)

#### A01 - Admit/Visit Notification

- Used for patient admission events
- Includes patient allergies via AL1 segments

## Message Segments

Generated HL7 messages include:

- **MSH**: Message Header - message metadata and routing
- **SCH**: Schedule Activity Information - appointment scheduling details
- **PID**: Patient Identification - demographics
- **PV1**: Patient Visit - encounter information
- **OBX**: Observation/Result - case events and clinical observations
- **AIS**: Appointment Information - Service - procedure details
- **NTE**: Notes and Comments - procedure descriptions and special needs
- **AIL**: Appointment Information - Location - OR location
- **AIP**: Appointment Information - Personnel - staff assignments
- **AL1**: Patient Allergy Information - allergy details (ADT only)

## Troubleshooting

### Application won't start

- Ensure Python 3.11+ is installed: `python --version`
- Check that all CSV files are present in the script directory
- Try running manually: `python HL7MessageCreatorFileView24Allergies.py`

### "Failed to load CSV files" error

- Verify all required CSV files exist in the same directory as the script
- Check CSV file format and column headers
- Ensure files are not corrupted or empty

### Messages not saving

- Check write permissions for the script directory
- Ensure folder names don't conflict with existing files
- Verify disk space is available

### HL7 parsing errors in Editor mode

- Validate HL7 file format (proper segment separators)
- Check for non-standard segments or encoding
- Try opening files individually to isolate problematic messages

## Version History

### FileView24Allergies (Current)

- Added allergy browser and management
- Simplified interface focused on core functionality
- Improved ADT message generation with AL1 segments
- Streamlined timestamp formatting

### FileView20 (Previous)

- Environment-specific field mapping (US Demo vs UCH)
- Advanced clinical fields (ASA Score, Laterality, Anesthesia Type, Isolations)
- Complex segment routing logic
- Additional seconds precision in timestamps
